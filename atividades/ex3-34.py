In the original image used to generate the three blurred images shown,
the vertical bars are 5 pixels wide, 100 pixels high, and their separation
is 20 pixels. The image was blurred using square box kernels of size
23, 25 and 45 elements on the side, respectively. The vertical bars on the 
left, lower part of (a) and (c) are blurred, but a clear separation exists between 
them.

However, the bars have merged in image (b), despite the fact that the kernel 
used to generate this image is much smaller than the kernel that 
produced image (c). Explain the reason for thia.
